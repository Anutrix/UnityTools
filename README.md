# Custom Unity Assets & Tools
> Custom made asset packages and tools for use with Unity

This repository contains a series of Unity asset packages and tools I've put together primarily for use across multiple personal projects, but also
for the free, open source use of any one that wants to use their features with full access on how I've put them together. At lot of these assets/tools
are works in progress, but the ones committed to the master branch can be considered released. I've bundled them all together to cut down on how many
repositories I'd need to separate them, but if the time comes where some of these tools become particularly complex/large, or are in active development,
whilst others are fixed then I'll endeavour to split them up.

Each of the assets packages/tools are listed in their own folder (see details below) with their own Unity projects, documentation, and usage instructions.
 
<br>
## Current Features
At the time of writing, this repository currently contains the following series of asset package and tools...

 - [**Runtime Gizmos:**](RuntimeGizmos) A series of very simple 3D manipulation gizmos to emulate those found in the Unity Editor's scene view but accessible at runtime without
the use of the editor APIs. More information here.

Any issues encountered, questions, or suggestions should be posted on the Unity Asset Store page of the relevant package, or on the GitHub issues page on the 
repository at github.com/CaptainHillman/UnityTools/issues.

See the UsageInstructions.pdf file inside each folder for more information on how to utilise each of the assets/tools listed above.
